Copyright year maintenance tool for C/CPP/Python/Typescript files.  This set of scripts is used to scan a file to identify
and parse the copyright comment text.  Then compare the current copyright comment year string with the .git or file system
creation and last modification years of the file.  If the .git/file system last modification year of the file is greater than
the current last year in the scanned and parsed copyright comment message from the file then the copyright comment message in
the file is automatically updated with the later modifcation year.
